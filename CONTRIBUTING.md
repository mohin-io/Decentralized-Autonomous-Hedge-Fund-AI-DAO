   - Reference any related issues
   - Ensure CI checks pass

## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Code

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where possible
- Add docstrings to all functions/classes (Google style)
- Keep functions focused and small (<50 lines)
- Use meaningful variable names

**Example**:
```python
def calculate_sharpe_ratio(
    returns: np.ndarray,
    risk_free_rate: float = 0.02
) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Sharpe ratio for a return series.

    Args:
        returns: Array of returns
        risk_free_rate: Annual risk-free rate

    Returns:
        Annualized Sharpe ratio
    """
    excess_returns = returns - (risk_free_rate / 252)
    return np.mean(excess_returns) / np.std(excess_returns) * np.sqrt(252)
```

### Solidity Code

- Follow Solidity style guide
- Add NatSpec comments
- Use latest stable version (0.8.20+)
- Include security checks (require, assert)
- Gas optimization when possible

**Example**:
```solidity
/// @notice Cast a vote on a proposal
/// @param proposalId ID of the proposal
/// @param support True for yes, false for no
function castVote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external {
    require(votingPower[msg.sender] > 0, "No voting power");
    // Implementation
}
```

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Formatting, no code change
- `refactor:` Code restructuring
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=agents --cov=environment --cov=utils
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Name test files `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test names
- Aim for >80% coverage

**Example**:
```python
def test_momentum_agent_prediction():
    """Test that momentum agent makes valid predictions"""
    agent = MomentumAgent()
    observation = np.random.randn(33)

    action = agent.predict(observation)

    assert action.shape == (3,)
    assert np.all(action >= -1) and np.all(action <= 1)
```
